Tasky Pro
=========

TaskyPro is a simple cross-platform todo/task application sample that allows
you to track todo tasks. It illustrates proper application architecture
layering and uses a common code base for the Business Layer, Data Access
Layer, and Data Layer layers. It then separates out the User
Interface and Application Layer into the appropriate device-applications.

The application runs on iOS and Android with a set of 
common classes shared across all platforms. It uses Shared Asset
Projects for the common code that is referenced from all platform-specific
projects.

Tasky Pro uses the Backendless Cloud database to store all to-do items. The
application demonstrates basic CRUD (Create, Retrieve, Update and Delete) operations
on a simple data structure.

NOTE: it also supports some basic iOS localization to [Spanish](Screenshots/iOS/03-detail_spanish.png) and [Japanese](Screenshots/iOS/04-detail_japanese.png).
