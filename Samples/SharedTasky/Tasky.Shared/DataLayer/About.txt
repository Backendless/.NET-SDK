Data Layer:
===========
The data layer is typically the lowest level layer of an application. Typically it consists 
of data persistence/retreival code. In this particular application, it contains one class:
 - TaskDatabase.cs

TaskDatabase
------------
TaskDatabase builds on the Backendless Cloud Database and represents a specific data table, 
in our case, the Task table. It contains methods for retreival and persistance, all based on
the Backendless ORM.
